MVCBootstrap
============

Bootstrap is great MVC5 is great lets combine the two together. 

Check out the images in the project to see what this can do. 

If you have any ideas on impovements/bugs found let me know. 

This currently is a project for MVC htmlHelpers

Current release is purely for a validation Summary helper. 

Next version due shortly will include the ability to indicate required fields and have a collapsable panel mode. 

Thanks for taking the time to come and view this little pet project of mine. 

Check the wiki for a more detailed description on how to use this:
